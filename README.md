Desktop diagramming app implemented using outside-in TDD, OO.

## Purpose

Learn about:
- [Growing Object Oriented Software Guided By Tests](https://www.amazon.com/Growing-Object-Oriented-Software-Guided-Tests/dp/0321503627)
- What is MVC, really?
- How to use events at a low level, to communicate between Models and Views, and different layers of an app.

## How to run?

You must have JDK 21, or newer, installed.
1. Run `./gradlew build`
2. Run `./gradlew run`

## Status

The goal of learning about some MVC patterns, and testing, has been achieved. The project is therefore finished.   
A more useful continuation of this idea can be found in the [hexa-draw](https://github.com/MilanVlaski/hexa-draw) project.
